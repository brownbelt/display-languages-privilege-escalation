## Description

In lpksetup.exe (Display Languages), there is a DLL loading vulnerability that
can be exploited by injecting an environment variable.

A load attempt to `%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\` + either "rsaenh.dll" or
"comsvcs.dll" (depending on OS version) will be performed from this
auto-elevated process.

Redirecting `%SYSTEMROOT%` can be achieved through Volatile Environment. For
this, we set `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Volatile Environment\SYSTEMROOT` to a new
directory, which we then populate with our hijacked payload DLL, along with
*.clb files from `C:\Windows\Registration` as they are loaded from our new
directory as well.

Then, as we execute lpksetup.exe, it will load our payload DLL and also the COM+
components. We need to copy those, too, because the process will otherwise
crash. Note, that we need to specify the runas verb, as the executable's
requestedExecutionLevel is asInvoker.

Our DLL is now executed with high IL. In this example, Payload.exe will be
started, which is an exemplary payload file displaying a MessageBox.

## Expected Result

When everything worked correctly, Payload.exe should be executed, displaying
basic information including integrity level.
